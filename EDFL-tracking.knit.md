## Increasing production

In June 2023, Houghton Library requested increased imaging production for the *[Dickinson Family Library](https://id.lib.harvard.edu/ead/hou00321/catalog)* project.

At the time, an **estimated 86,847 page-images remained**, and our production rate would have had us **completing the project in 2034**.

Through consultation, testing and evaluation, Houghton and Imaging Services revised the sorting criteria used to determine which books require specialized handling and photography from those well-matched to our standardized, higher-production, photography service. **The updated sorting criteria dramatically increased the proportion of books routed to the higher-throughput service.**

Subsequently, **Imaging Services has completed 7 batches between June 2023 and April 2024, with page-images totaling 13,595--an average 1,389 per month**.

### At our current production rate

With **73,252 images remaining**, and our current **production rate of 1,389 per month**, our **projected project completion date is August 23, 2028**.

### Targeting a date for completing the project

If we set a **goal to end the project on June 30, 2026**, for example, our production rate needs to be **2,719 images per month**. In practice, ensuring we complete the project on-time will require setting a more ambitious target, in recognition that we will periodically fail to hit any mark we set. Therefore, <mark>**Imaging Services recommends Houghton deliver 4000--5000 pages monthly to *D20*, in addition to any batches it delivers to *D40*, and that we reassess our progress in October 2024**</mark>.
